# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Kailo Ando

## Skills and Experience
Currently most of my experience comes for the projects and assignments tasked to me in university. After my graduation from Univerisity of Toronto I started to learn about web development as that was my weakest skill at the time. I have created some web apps I am proud of like an [Auction House](https://github.com/Ando52/AuctionHouse) and [Mail System](https://github.com/Ando52/MailSystem)
